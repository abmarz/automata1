# Plang 1 - Homework Repository - Abdullah Al Marzouq

👑 Hear Ye! Hear Ye! 📣 🎪🃏

Allow me to present unto thee mine humble collection of scholarly endeavors. Within this folder, thou shalt find the fruits of mine labor— okay I think that's enough to get your attention. 🧏‍♂️🧏‍♀️ 

Welcome to my submission folder/dropbox/repository (whichever you'd like to call it, I like to call it repository). In this repository, you will find my homework submissions for the CMSI 3801 class at LMU. Kindly read the footnotes that will be updated in this README for each homework as they are important (at least for me). ❗️ These footnotes serve as a space for my reflections/remarks that I wish to clarify to the instructor/grader(s) with each respective homework assignment, as well as a place to give credits (if any). Some footnotes are numbered and commented next to their respective line of code for your reference. They look like this: (HWF ...). Footnotes will be updated after each homework cycle, placing the latest ones at the top of this README and old ones at the very bottom for archival purposes. 📑🔍

My hope is that my work can stand on its merits to serve as a testament to the earnest pursuit of understanding that I am embarking on for this course. 🙏🤝🍎📚

I would say enjoy, but I'm assuming the people who are reading my homework submissions are doing so by necessity and may not view it as an enjoyable task. But if you do enjoy doing so... go crazy! 💥

If you have any questions, you can reach me on email 📧 (aalmarz3@lion.lmu.edu) or slack 📲 (@abmarz).

THIS WORK IS THE PROPERTY OF ABDULLAH ALMARZOUQ (LMU STUDENT ID: 985553697) INTEDED FOR CMSI3801. ALL CREDITS, IF ANY, WILL BE PLACED IN THE FOOTNOTES. THIS REPOSITORY IS PUBLIC WITHOUT CHOICE AS I AM UNABLE TO MAKE IT PRIVATE (GITHUB DOOZYS), THEREFORE MAKING THE CONTENTS OF MY REPOSITORY PRONE TO PLAGIARISM BY OTHERS. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF MY GITHUB DOOZY AND PLAGIARIZE MY WORK. SHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO PLAGIARIZE, DO SO AT YOUR OWN PERIL BECAUSE IT CAN EASILY BE TRACED BACK WITH TIMESTAMPS

## Homework 2 Footnote
WHEW! Talk about upping the ante. Throughout this homework, some functions passed, some functions failed, some had a mixture of success and failure, and some would not work no matter how much I tried to troubleshoot 😢 This is the first time I have truly experienced burnout this semester and I unfortunately have no mental capacity to troubleshoot anymore. While I do not expect a high grade on this submission, I would really appreciate any partial credits or extra credits given throughout the semester to help boost our grades 👉👈 (I really want to pass this class 😔).

In the spirit of academic integrity, I must give credit to any help I have received on this assignment. There have been a pool of people, and robots, that helped me understand and write some lines of code. Help was received by fellow peers from the keck lab, supplemental tutors that helped me understand core concepts for each question, and copilot on VScode. All credits to the aforementioned have been placed throughout the codes in their respective areas of help. 🙌🙌🙌

*Please note that the use of copilot here was purely for aid within an already established line of code, and never for writing the entire code from scratch. On my honor, the use of copilot here was in compliance with the syllabus rules and regulations for AI under the 'Generative AI and Your Learning' section.

## Grading Notes (by instructor)

Your grade is a reflection not only of your ability to write code to pass existing tests, but also of your ability to construct software in a professional setting. Therefore, the following will contribute rather heavily to your score:

- **Following all submission instructions**! Pay attention to every requirement such as replacing the contents of this readme file and including the names of all participants of any group work.
- **Keeping a pristine GitHub repository**. Do not push any file that does not belong (including but not limited to that silly `DS_Store`). Make sure all generated executables, intermediate files, third-party libraries, etc. are not committed. Your repo contents should be limited to your solution files, tests, configuration files, and `.gitignore` files.
- **Adherence to naming and formatting conventions for the language you are writing in**. Inconsistent indentation, for example, has no place in professional or student software. Neither does end-of-line whitespace, huge chunks of contiguous blank lines, and other types of messy coding practices that show friends, family, colleagues, and potential employers that you don’t care about your work.
- (As always) The **readability and maintainability** of your code.
